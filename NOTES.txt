NOTES:

1. The client CAN connect to an IRC server, but at the moment IRC servers boot me off the server (not sure how to fix this)

e.g. if you connect to irc.freenode.net on port 6667 it will connect

Here is some example output:

Welcome to Miguel's IM Application.

2. I HAVE ONLY BUILT IT FOR MAC!!! I can't be bothered to download/install boost (which is the library I require to build the program) for Windows, so please if you want to try it, try it on a Mac


3. The Server has currently NOT been implemented yet
